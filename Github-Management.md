# Github Management

In the past, the Github was managed ad-hoc by anyone involved in Outreach. Going forward, we would like to gain a bit more control and bring some order to it, so that it is easy to use for all future *Outreachers*.

## Permissions Structure

We would like to use the following structure:

| Item | Role | Team | Description |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:------------|
| Group | Owner | (Per-user permission) | Caroline, Outreach Teaching Assistant(s) (past, present and future) |
| Group | Admin | Coordinators | Caroline, Outreach Teaching Assistant(s) (past, present and future), Anyone with special permission |
| Group | Member | Contributors | All other outreach workers |
| Repo | Admin/Owner | (Per repo collaborators) | The person who created the repository / created the content of the repo |
| Repo | Contributor | (Per repo collaborators) | People helping to add content to a repo should be given Write access. Possibly with a restriction on the Master branch. |

## Special Repositories

There are four *special repositories* that everyone has write access to except the master branch, which requires an approved pull request with no requested changes and a member of the Coordinators team to merge. These special repos are:

* Coordination (This repo)
* LaTeX-Worksheet-Templates
* Web-Tutorial-Template
* Worksheet-PDFs

These are special repos because they are integral to the smooth running of the Outreach programme.
