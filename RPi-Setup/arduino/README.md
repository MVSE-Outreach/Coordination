# Arduino installation

The Arduino IDE is available in the official repositories, however it is
frequently out of date, this is where this script comes in. It downloads
version **1.6.5** and installs it via `dpkg`. If you're comfortable with using
an older version of the IDE then simply `sudo apt install arduino`.

## Usage

```
$ ./install_arduino_ide.sh
```
